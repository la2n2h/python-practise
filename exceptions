Imagine you have two numbers and want to determine what happens when you divide one number by the other. To do this, you need to create a Python function called safe_divide. You give this function two numbers, a 'numerator' and a 'denominator'. The 'numerator' is the number you want to divide, and the 'denominator' is the number you want to divide by. Use the user input method of Python to take the values.

The function should be able to do the division for you and give you the result. But here's the catch: if you try to divide by zero (which is not allowed in math), the function should be smart enough to catch that and tell you that it's not possible to divide by zero. Instead of showing an error, it should return None, which means 'nothing' or 'no value', and print "Error: Cannot divide by Zero.

# create function of safe_devide 

```
def safe_divide(numerator,denominator) :
    try:
        result = numerator / denominator
        return (result)
    except ZeroDivisionError: 
        print ("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
        return None
```

# create input space for numerator and denominator

``` 
numerator=int(input("Enter the numerator value:-"))
denominator=int(input("Enter the denominator value:-"))
print(safe_divide(numerator,denominator))
```
Enter the numerator value:- 10
Enter the denominator value:- 2
5.0
